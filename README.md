# SF Public Data Hackathon


Saturday, February 17

9:30 AM - 7:00 PM


[Hex](https://hex.tech/) and [Modelbit](https://modelbit.com/) are excited to host a day-long public data hackathon at the Hex HQ in SF. Come dive into carefully curated datasets, learn to use Hex and Modelbit for data exploration and machine learning, and build data apps that'll blow people's minds.

The theme is **Infinite City** (San Francisco, of course). ****We’ll have hundreds of interesting SF datasets to dig into— and not just the same old stuff (no poop maps allowed!). Your investigations and insights should be adventures into the unknown, celebrations of the odd and niche, and things that make you look at this marvelous city in a whole new light.

**For Example:**

- Build an ML model that predicts the movement of Karl the Fog.
- Parse historical records to find "cursed" restaurant locations and warn their current tenants.
- Model the impact of weather on human traffic flow around the city.

There will be:

- Prizes
- Delicious food (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)
- Interesting datasets
- Hands-on tutorials and instruction on Hex & Modelbit
- Lots of great data people to meet!
